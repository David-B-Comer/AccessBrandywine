# AccessBrandywine
a flutter app to manage public/semi-public access to riverine resources.

### Idea.

A group of people have homes along the Brandywine River in Southeastern PA.  
They love giving people permission to access the river via their properties, but as of late they are getting overwhelmed with people they don’t know.
They’d like a simple web/mobile app, where someone could download, and ask for permission (perhaps sign a waiver), know where to park, etc.
So they could put signs up, saying download the web app, the land owners could see who was on their property, and have ability to manage it, etc.

### Possibles

- map integration to show where the user is, and where parking/access slots are.
- signup, with oAuth (facebook or google).
- facebook would allow for RW ID?
- permission ask/grant
- waiver - check with phone id
- track phoneid anonymously
- track usage within a geo boundary. geofencing

- admin/owner access
  - able to see who and when the users were
  - alerts on access?
  - yes/no on access?

### Tech Stack

- ui flutter (for easy ios/android distribution)
- dart (flutter) for business logic
- firebase for Auth and DB tracking.
- May need open map API of some kind (leaflet?)
- Maybe map is hardwired?

### ToDos

- flutter video
- longer tutorial startup name gen
- google maps, or leaflet?
- 14K auth a month. before payment.
- thinking about the screens/pages and their flow
  - red vs. green for access
- needs a admin UI that the sponsors have access to approve or deny access to a user
- card has name and Photo?
- approval before arrival and/or at arrival
- presumptive approval, and explicit denial?? is that something they're comfortable with/
- prototype - for jeff, balsamiq (or other wireframing tools)
