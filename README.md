# AccessBrandywine
a flutter app to manage public/semi-public access to riverine resources.

### Idea.

A group of people have homes along the Brandywine River in Southeastern PA.  
They love giving people permission to access the river via their properties, but as of late they are getting overwhelmed with people they don’t know.
They’d like a simple web/mobile app, where someone could download, and ask for permission (perhaps sign a waiver), know where to park, etc.
So they could put signs up, saying download the web app, the land owners could see who was on their property, and have ability to manage it, etc.
